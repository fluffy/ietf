		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t>
				This document describes how Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer <xref target="RFC3264"/> and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
				The ICE specification <xref target="ICE-BIS"/> describes procedures that are common to all usages of ICE and this document gives the additional details needed to use ICE with SDP offer/answer and SIP.
			</t>

			<t>Note that ICE is not intended for NAT traversal for SIP, which is assumed to be provided via another mechanism <xref target="RFC5626"/>.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Terminology">
			<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

			<t> Readers should be familiar with the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC3264"/>, 
			in <xref target="ICE-BIS" /> and the following:</t>

			<t>
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="Default Destination/Candidate:">
						The default destination for a component of a media stream is the transport address that would be used by an agent that is not ICE aware.
						A default candidate for a component is one whose transport address matches the default destination for that component.
						For the RTP component, the default IP address is in the "c=" line of the SDP, and the port is in the "m=" line.
						For the RTCP component, it is in the rtcp attribute when present, and when not present, the IP address is in the "c=" line and 1 plus the port is in the "m=" line.
					</t>
				</list>
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Sending the Initial Offer">
			<section anchor="sec-inuse" title="Choosing Default Candidates">
				<t>
					A candidate is said to be default if it would be the target of media from a non-ICE peer; that target is called the DEFAULT DESTINATION.
					If the default candidates are not selected by the ICE algorithm when communicating with an ICE-aware peer, an updated offer/answer will be required after ICE processing completes in order to "fix up" the SDP so that the default destination for media matches the candidates selected by ICE.
					If ICE happens to select the default candidates, no updated offer/answer is required.
				</t>

				<!-- TODO: always send updated offer? -->
				<t>
					An agent MUST choose a set of candidates, one for each component of each in-use media stream, to be default.
					A media stream is in-use if it does not have a port of zero (which is used in RFC 3264 to reject a media stream).
					Consequently, a media stream is in-use even if it is marked as a=inactive <xref target="RFC4566"/> or has a bandwidth value of zero.
				</t>

				<t>
					It is RECOMMENDED that default candidates be chosen based on the likelihood of those candidates to work with the peer that is being contacted if ICE is not being used.
					It is RECOMMENDED that the default candidates are the relayed candidates (if relayed candidates are available), server reflexive candidates (if server reflexive candidates are available), and finally host candidates.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="sec-encoding" title="Encoding the SDP">
				<t>The process of encoding the SDP is identical between full and lite implementations.</t>

				<t>
					The agent will include an "m=" line for each media stream it wishes to use.
					The ordering of media streams in the SDP is relevant for ICE. ICE will perform its connectivity checks for the first "m=" line first, and consequently media will be able to flow for that stream first.
					Agents SHOULD place their most important media stream, if there is one, first in the SDP.
				</t>

				<t>There will be a candidate attribute for each candidate for a particular media stream. <xref target="sec-grammar"/> provides detailed rules for constructing this attribute.</t>

				<t>
					STUN connectivity checks between agents are authenticated using the short-term credential mechanism defined for STUN <xref target="RFC5389"/>.
					This mechanism relies on a username and password that are exchanged through protocol machinery between the client and server.
					The username fragment and password are exchanged in the ice-ufrag and ice-pwd attributes, respectively.
				</t>

				<t>
					If an agent is a lite implementation, it MUST include an "a=ice-lite" session-level attribute in its SDP to indicate this.
					If an agent is a full implementation, it MUST NOT include this attribute.
				</t>

				<t>
					The default candidates are added to the SDP as the default destination for media.
					For streams based on RTP, this is done by placing the IP address and port of the RTP candidate into the "c=" and "m=" lines, respectively.
					If the agent is utilizing RTCP, it MUST encode the RTCP candidate using the a=rtcp attribute as defined in <xref target="RFC3605">RFC 3605</xref>.
					If RTCP is not in use, the agent MUST signal that using b=RS:0 and b=RR:0 as defined in <xref target="RFC3556">RFC 3556</xref>.
				</t>

				<t>The transport addresses that will be the default destination for media when communicating with non-ICE peers MUST also be present as candidates in one or more a=candidate lines.</t>

				<t>
					ICE provides for extensibility by allowing an offer or answer to contain a series of tokens that identify the ICE extensions used by that agent.
					If an agent supports an ICE extension, it MUST include the token defined for that extension in the ice-options attribute.
				</t>

				<t>The following is an example SDP message that includes ICE attributes (lines folded for readability):</t>

				<t>
					Once an agent has sent its offer or its answer, that agent MUST be prepared to receive both STUN and media packets on each candidate.
					As discussed in Section 10.1 of <xref target="ICE-BIS" />, media packets can be sent to a candidate prior to its appearance as the default destination for media in an offer or answer.
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section title="Receiving the Initial Offer">
			<section title="Choosing Default Candidates">
				<t>The process for selecting default candidates at the answerer is identical to the process followed by the offerer, as described in <xref target="sec-inuse"/> for full implementations and <!-- sec-offer-lite --> 4.2 of <xref target="ICE-BIS" /> for lite implementations.</t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="sec-verify" title="Verifying ICE Support">
				<t>
					The agent will proceed with the ICE procedures defined in <xref target="ICE-BIS"/> and this specification if, for each media stream in the SDP it received, the default destination for each component of that media stream appears in a candidate attribute.
					For example, in the case of RTP, the IP address and port in the "c=" and "m=" lines, respectively, appear in a candidate attribute and the value in the rtcp attribute appears in a candidate attribute.
				</t>

				<t>
					If this condition is not met, the agent MUST process the SDP based on normal RFC 3264 procedures, without using any of the ICE mechanisms described in the remainder of this specification with the following exceptions:</t>

				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t> The agent MUST follow the rules of section <!-- keepalive --> 10 of <xref target="ICE-BIS" />, which describe keepalive procedures for all agents.</t>

						<t>If the agent is not proceeding with ICE because there were a=candidate attributes, but none that matched the default destination of the media stream, the agent MUST include an a=ice-mismatch attribute in its answer.</t>

						<t>
							If the default candidates were relayed candidates learned through a TURN server, the agent MUST create permissions in the TURN server for the IP addresses learned from its peer in the SDP it just received.
							If this is not done, initial packets in the media stream from the peer may be lost.
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Determining Role">
			  <t>  In unusual cases, described in <xref target="sec-glare"/>, it is possible for both agents to mistakenly believe they are controlled or controlling. To resolve this, each agent MUST select a random number, called the tie-breaker, uniformly distributed between 0 and (2**64) - 1 (that is, a 64-bit positive integer). This number is used in connectivity checks to detect and repair this case, as described in <!-- ICE-CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING --> Section 7.1.2.2 of <xref target="ICE-BIS"/>. </t>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section title="Receipt of the Initial Answer">
			<t>
				When ICE is used with SIP, forking may result in a single offer generating a multiplicity of answers.
				In that case, ICE proceeds completely in parallel and independently for each answer, treating the combination of its offer and each answer as an independent offer/answer exchange, with its own set of pairs, check lists, states, and so on.
				The only case in which processing of one pair impacts another is freeing of candidates, discussed below in <xref target="sec-freeing"/>.
			</t>

			<section anchor="sec-overify" title="Verifying ICE Support">
				<t>The logic at the offerer is identical to that of the answerer as described in section 5.1 <!--sec-verify--> of <xref target="ICE-BIS" />, with the exception that an offerer would not ever generate a=ice-mismatch attributes in an SDP.</t>

				<t>
					In some cases, the answer may omit a=candidate attributes for the media streams, and instead include an a=ice-mismatch attribute for one or more of the media streams in the SDP.
					This signals to the offerer that the answerer supports ICE, but that ICE processing was not used for the session because a signaling intermediary modified the default destination for media components without modifying the corresponding candidate attributes.
					See <xref target="sec-alg-sip"/> for a discussion of cases where this can happen.
					This specification provides no guidance on how an agent should proceed in such a failure case.
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sec-connectivity_check" title="Performing Connectivity Checks">
		  <t> The possibility for role conflicts described in <!-- "Detecting and Repairing Role Conflicts" --> Section 7.2.1.1 of <xref target="ICE-BIS"/> applies to this usage and hence all full agents MUST implement the role conflict repairing mechanism. Also both full and lite agents MUST utilize the ICE-CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING attributes as described in <!-- ICE-CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING --> Section 7.1.2.2 of <xref target="ICE-BIS"/>. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sec-conclude" title="Concluding ICE">
			<t>Once all of the media streams are completed, the controlling endpoint sends an updated offer if the transport
			destination in the "m=" and "c=" lines for the media stream (called the DEFAULT CANDIDATES) don't match ICE's SELECTED CANDIDATES.</t>

			<!-- TODO: send updated offer always? -->

			<section title="Procedures for Full Implementations">
				<section title="Updating states">
					<t>
						Once the state of each check list is Completed, If an agent is controlling, it examines the highest-priority nominated candidate pair for each component of each media stream.
						If any of those candidate pairs differ from the default candidate pairs in the most recent offer/answer exchange, the controlling agent MUST generate an updated offer as described in <xref target="sec-subsequent"/>.
					</t>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section anchor="sec-freeing" title="Freeing Candidates">
				<section title="Full Implementation Procedures">
					<t>
						When ICE is used with SIP, and an offer is forked to multiple recipients, ICE proceeds in parallel and independently with each answerer, all using the same local candidates.
						Once ICE processing has reached the Completed state for all peers for media streams using those candidates, the agent SHOULD wait an additional three seconds, and then it MAY cease responding to checks or generating triggered checks on that candidate.
						It MAY free the candidate at that time.
						Freeing of server reflexive candidates is never explicit; it happens by lack of a keepalive. The three-second delay handles cases when aggressive nomination is used, and the selected pairs can quickly change after ICE has completed.

								When parsing this field, an agent can differentiate an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address by presence of a colon in its value -- the presence of a colon indicates IPv6. An agent MUST ignore candidate lines that include candidates with IP address versions that are not supported or recognized.
								An IP address SHOULD be used, but an FQDN MAY be used in place of an IP address.
								In that case, when receiving an offer or answer containing an FQDN in an a=candidate attribute, the FQDN is looked up in the DNS first using an AAAA record (assuming the agent supports IPv6), and if no result is found or the agent only supports IPv4, using an A.

					The "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag" attributes can appear at either the session-level or media-level.
					When present in both, the value in the media-level takes precedence.
					Thus, the value at the session-level is effectively a default that applies to all media streams, unless overridden by a media-level value.
					Whether present at the session or media-level, there MUST be an ice-pwd and ice-ufrag attribute for each media stream.
					If two media streams have identical ice-ufrag's, they MUST have identical ice-pwd's.
				</t>

				<t>
					The ice-ufrag and ice-pwd attributes MUST be chosen randomly at the beginning of a session.
					The ice-ufrag attribute MUST contain at least 24 bits of randomness, and the ice-pwd attribute MUST contain at least 128 bits of randomness.
					This means that the ice-ufrag attribute will be at least 4 characters long, and the ice-pwd at least 22 characters long, since the grammar for these attributes allows for 6 bits of randomness per character.
					The attributes MAY be longer than 4 and 22 characters, respectively, of course, up to 256 characters.
					The upper limit allows for buffer sizing in implementations.
					Its large upper limit allows for increased amounts of randomness to be added over time.
					For compatibility with the 512 character limitation for the STUN username attribute value and for bandwidth conservation considerations, the ice-ufrag attribute MUST NOT be longer than 32 characters when sending, but an implementation  MUST accept up to 256 characters when receiving.

		<section title="Usage with SIP">
			<section anchor="sec-latency" title="Latency Guidelines">
				<t>
					ICE requires a series of STUN-based connectivity checks to take place between endpoints.
					These checks start from the answerer on generation of its answer, and start from the offerer when it receives the answer.
					These checks can take time to complete, and as such, the selection of messages to use with offers and answers can affect perceived user latency.
					Two latency figures are of particular interest.
					These are the post-pickup delay and the post-dial delay.
					The post-pickup delay refers to the time between when a user "answers the phone" and when any speech they utter can be delivered to the caller.
					The post-dial delay refers to the time between when a user enters the destination address for the user and ringback begins as a consequence of having successfully started ringing the phone of the called party.
				</t>

				<t>Two cases can be considered -- one where the offer is present in the initial INVITE and one where it is in a response.</t>

				<section title="Offer in INVITE">
					<t>
						To reduce post-dial delays, it is RECOMMENDED that the caller begin gathering candidates prior to actually sending its initial INVITE.
						This can be started upon user interface cues that a call is pending, such as activity on a keypad or the phone going off-hook.
					</t>

					<t>
						If an offer is received in an INVITE request, the answerer SHOULD begin to gather its candidates on receipt of the offer and then generate an answer in a provisional response once it has completed that process.
						ICE requires that a provisional response with an SDP be transmitted reliably.
						This can be done through the existing Provisional Response Acknowledgment (PRACK) mechanism <xref target="RFC3262"/> or through an optimization that is specific to ICE.
						With this optimization, provisional responses containing an SDP answer that begins ICE processing for one or more media streams can be sent reliably without RFC 3262.
						To do this, the agent retransmits the provisional response with the exponential backoff timers described in RFC 3262.
						Retransmits MUST cease on receipt of a STUN Binding request for one of the media streams signaled in that SDP (because receipt of a Binding request indicates the offerer has received the answer) or on transmission of the answer in a 2xx response.
						If the peer agent is lite, there will never be a STUN Binding request.
						In such a case, the agent MUST cease retransmitting the 18x after sending it four times (ICE will actually work even if the peer never receives the 18x; however, experience has shown that sending it is important for middleboxes and firewall traversal).
						If no Binding request is received prior to the last retransmit, the agent does not consider the session terminated.
						Despite the fact that the provisional response will be delivered reliably, the rules for when an agent can send an updated offer or answer do not change from those specified in RFC 3262.
						Specifically, if the INVITE contained an offer, the same answer appears in all of the 1xx and in the 2xx response to the INVITE.
						Only after that 2xx has been sent can an updated offer/answer exchange occur.
						This optimization SHOULD NOT be used if both agents support PRACK.
						Note that the optimization is very specific to provisional response carrying answers that start ICE processing; it is not a general technique for 1xx reliability.
					</t>

					<t>Alternatively, an agent MAY delay sending an answer until the 200 OK; however, this results in a poor user experience and is NOT RECOMMENDED.</t>

					<t>
						Once the answer has been sent, the agent SHOULD begin its connectivity checks.
						Once candidate pairs for each component of a media stream enter the valid list, the answerer can begin sending media on that media stream.
					</t>

					<t>
						However, prior to this point, any media that needs to be sent towards the caller (such as SIP early media <xref target="RFC3960"/>) MUST NOT be transmitted.
						For this reason, implementations SHOULD delay alerting the called party until candidates for each component of each media stream have entered the valid list.
						In the case of a PSTN gateway, this would mean that the setup message into the PSTN is delayed until this point.
						Doing this increases the post-dial delay, but has the effect of eliminating 'ghost rings'.
						Ghost rings are cases where the called party hears the phone ring, picks up, but hears nothing and cannot be heard.
						This technique works without requiring support for, or usage of, preconditions <xref target="RFC3312"/>, since it's a localized decision.
						It also has the benefit of guaranteeing that not a single packet of media will get clipped, so that post-pickup delay is zero.
						If an agent chooses to delay local alerting in this way, it SHOULD generate a 180 response once alerting begins.
					</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Offer in Response">
					<t>
						In addition to uses where the offer is in an INVITE, and the answer is in the provisional and/or 200 OK response, ICE works with cases where the offer appears in the response.
						In such cases, which are common in third party call control <xref target="RFC3725"/>, ICE agents SHOULD generate their offers in a reliable provisional response (which MUST utilize RFC 3262), and not alert the user on receipt of the INVITE.
						The answer will arrive in a PRACK. This allows for ICE processing to take place prior to alerting, so that there is no post-pickup delay, at the expense of increased call setup delays.
						Once ICE completes, the callee can alert the user and then generate a 200 OK when they answer.
						The 200 OK would contain no SDP, since the offer/answer exchange has completed.
					</t>

					<t>
						Alternatively, agents MAY place the offer in a 2xx instead (in which case the answer comes in the ACK).
						When this happens, the callee will alert the user on receipt of the INVITE, and the ICE exchanges will take place only after the user answers.
						This has the effect of reducing call setup delay, but can cause substantial post-pickup delays and media clipping.
					</t>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section title="SIP Option Tags and Media Feature Tags">
				<t>
					<xref target="RFC5768"/> specifies a SIP option tag and media feature tag for usage with ICE.
					ICE implementations using SIP SHOULD support this specification, which uses a feature tag in registrations to facilitate interoperability through signaling intermediaries.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Interactions with Forking">
				<t>
					ICE interacts very well with forking. Indeed, ICE fixes some of the problems associated with forking.
					Without ICE, when a call forks and the caller receives multiple incoming media streams, it cannot determine which media stream corresponds to which callee.
				</t>

				<t>
					With ICE, this problem is resolved.
					The connectivity checks which occur prior to transmission of media carry username fragments, which in turn are correlated to a specific callee.
					Subsequent media packets that arrive on the same candidate pair as the connectivity check will be associated with that same callee.
					Thus, the caller can perform this correlation as long as it has received an answer.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Interactions with Preconditions">
				<t>
					Quality of Service (QoS) preconditions, which are defined in RFC 3312 <xref target="RFC3312"/> and RFC 4032 <xref target="RFC4032"/>, apply only to the transport addresses listed as the default targets for media in an offer/answer.
					If ICE changes the transport address where media is received, this change is reflected in an updated offer that changes the default destination for media to match ICE's selection.
					As such, it appears like any other re-INVITE would, and is fully treated in RFCs 3312 and 4032, which apply without regard to the fact that the destination for media is changing due to ICE negotiations occurring "in the background".
				</t>

				<t>Indeed, an agent SHOULD NOT indicate that QoS preconditions have been met until the checks have completed and selected the candidate pairs to be used for media.</t>

				<t>
					ICE also has (purposeful) interactions with connectivity preconditions <xref target="RFC5898"/>.
					Those interactions are described there.
					Note that the procedures described in <xref target="sec-latency"/> describe their own type of "preconditions", albeit with less functionality than those provided by the explicit preconditions in <xref target="RFC5898"/>.

			<section title="Interactions with Third Party Call Control">
				<t>
					ICE works with Flows I, III, and IV as described in <xref target="RFC3725"/>.
					Flow I works without the controller supporting or being aware of ICE.
					Flow IV will work as long as the controller passes along the ICE attributes without alteration.
					Flow II is fundamentally incompatible with ICE; each agent will believe itself to be the answerer and thus never generate a re-INVITE.
				</t>

				<t>
					The flows for continued operation, as described in Section 7 of RFC 3725, require additional behavior of ICE implementations to support.
					In particular, if an agent receives a mid-dialog re-INVITE that contains no offer, it MUST restart ICE for each media stream and go through the process of gathering new candidates.
					Furthermore, that list of candidates SHOULD include the ones currently being used for media.

		<section title="Relationship with ANAT">
			<t>
				RFC 4091 <xref target="RFC4091"/>, the Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics for the SDP grouping framework, and RFC 4092 <xref target="RFC4092"/>, its usage with SIP, define a mechanism for indicating that an agent can support both IPv4 and IPv6 for a media stream, and it does so by including two "m=" lines, one for v4 and one for v6.
				This is similar to ICE, which allows for an agent to indicate multiple transport addresses using the candidate attribute.
				However, ANAT relies on static selection to pick between choices, rather than a dynamic connectivity check used by ICE.
			</t>

			<t>This specification deprecates RFC 4091 and RFC 4092. Instead, agents wishing to support dual-stack will utilize ICE.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Setting Ta and RTO for RTP Media Streams">
			<t>
			During the gathering phase of ICE (section 4.1.1 <xref target="ICE-BIS"/>) 
			and while ICE is performing connectivity checks (section 7 <xref target="ICE-BIS"/>), 
			an agent sends STUN and TURN transactions.  These transactions are paced at a
  			rate of one every Ta milliseconds, and utilize a specific RTO.  See Section 13.1 of
  			<xref target="ICE-BIS"/> for details on how the valies of Ta and RTO are computed
  			with a real-time media stream of known maximum bandwith to rate-control the ICE exchanges.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Security Considerations">
			<section title="Attacks on the Offer/Answer Exchanges">
				<t>
					An attacker that can modify or disrupt the offer/answer exchanges themselves can readily launch a variety of attacks with ICE.
					They could direct media to a target of a DoS attack, they could insert themselves into the media stream, and so on.
					These are similar to the general security considerations for offer/answer exchanges, and the security considerations in RFC 3264 <xref target="RFC3264"/> apply.
					These require techniques for message integrity and encryption for offers and answers, which are satisfied by the SIPS mechanism <xref target="RFC3261"/> when SIP is used.
					As such, the usage of SIPS with ICE is RECOMMENDED.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Insider Attacks">
				<t>In addition to attacks where the attacker is a third party trying to insert fake offers, answers, or stun messages, there are several attacks possible with ICE when the attacker is an authenticated and valid participant in the ICE exchange.</t>

				<section anchor="sec-voice-hammer" title="The Voice Hammer Attack">
					<t>
						The voice hammer attack is an amplification attack.
						In this attack, the attacker initiates sessions to other agents, and maliciously includes the IP address and port of a DoS target as the destination for media traffic signaled in the SDP.
						This causes substantial amplification; a single offer/answer exchange can create a continuing flood of media packets, possibly at high rates (consider video sources).
						This attack is not specific to ICE, but ICE can help provide remediation.
					</t>

					<t>
						Specifically, if ICE is used, the agent receiving the malicious SDP will first perform connectivity checks to the target of media before sending media there.
						If this target is a third-party host, the checks will not succeed, and media is never sent.
					</t>

					<t>
						Unfortunately, ICE doesn't help if its not used, in which case an attacker could simply send the offer without the ICE parameters.
						However, in environments where the set of clients is known, and is limited to ones that support ICE, the server can reject any offers or answers that don't indicate ICE support.
					</t>
				</section>

				<section anchor="sec-alg-sip" title="Interactions with Application Layer Gateways and SIP">
					<t>
						Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) are functions present in a NAT device that inspect the contents of packets and modify them, in order to facilitate NAT traversal for application protocols.
						Session Border Controllers (SBCs) are close cousins of ALGs, but are less transparent since they actually exist as application layer SIP intermediaries.
						ICE has interactions with SBCs and ALGs.
					</t>

					<t>
						If an ALG is SIP aware but not ICE aware, ICE will work through it as long as the ALG correctly modifies the SDP.
						A correct ALG implementation behaves as follows:
					</t>

					<t>
						<list style="symbols">
							<t>The ALG does not modify the "m=" and "c=" lines or the rtcp attribute if they contain external addresses.</t>
							<t>If the "m=" and "c=" lines contain internal addresses, the modification depends on the state of the ALG:
								<list style="empty">
									<t>If the ALG already has a binding established that maps an external port to an internal IP address and port matching the values in the "m=" and "c=" lines or rtcp attribute, the ALG uses that binding instead of creating a new one.</t>
									<t>If the ALG does not already have a binding, it creates a new one and modifies the SDP, rewriting the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attribute.</t>
								</list>
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>

					<t>
						Unfortunately, many ALGs are known to work poorly in these corner cases.
						ICE does not try to work around broken ALGs, as this is outside the scope of its functionality.
						ICE can help diagnose these conditions, which often show up as a mismatch between the set of candidates and the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attributes.
						The ice-mismatch attribute is used for this purpose.
					</t>

					<t>
						ICE works best through ALGs when the signaling is run over TLS.
						This prevents the ALG from manipulating the SDP messages and interfering with ICE operation.
						Implementations that are expected to be deployed behind ALGs SHOULD provide for TLS transport of the SDP.
					</t>

					<t>
						If an SBC is SIP aware but not ICE aware, the result depends on the behavior of the SBC.
						If it is acting as a proper Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), the SBC will remove any SDP attributes it doesn't understand, including the ICE attributes.
						Consequently, the call will appear to both endpoints as if the other side doesn't support ICE.
						This will result in ICE being disabled, and media flowing through the SBC, if the SBC has requested it.
						If, however, the SBC passes the ICE attributes without modification, yet modifies the default destination for media (contained in the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attribute), this will be detected as an ICE mismatch, and ICE processing is aborted for the call.
						It is outside of the scope of ICE for it to act as a tool for "working around" SBCs.
						If one is present, ICE will not be used and the SBC techniques take precedence.

				<t>IANA maintains a registry for ice-options identifiers under the Specification Required policy as defined in <xref target="RFC5226">"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.</t>

				<t>
					ICE options are of unlimited length according to the syntax in <xref target="sec-ice-options" />; however, they are RECOMMENDED to be no longer than 20 characters.
					This is to reduce message sizes and allow for efficient parsing.
				</t>

				<t>
					In RFC 5245 ICE options could only be defined at the session level.

					This can be used when aggregating between different ICE agents in the same endpoint, but future options may require to be defined at the media-level.
					To ensure compatibility with legacy implementation, the media-level ICE options MUST be aggregated into a session-level ICE option.
					Because aggregation rules depend on the specifics of each option, all new ICE options MUST also define in their specification how the media-level ICE option values are aggregated to generate the value of the session-level ICE option.
				</t>

					The only ICE option defined at the time of publication is <xref target="RFC6679">"rtp+ecn"</xref>.

							This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia sessions established with the offer/answer model.
							This protocol is called Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE).
							ICE makes use of the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and its extension, Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).
							ICE can be used by any protocol utilizing the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

				The a=remote-candidates attribute exists to eliminate a race condition between the updated offer and the response to the STUN Binding request that moved a candidate into the Valid list.

				On receipt of message 4, agent L adds a candidate pair to the valid list.

			<t>
				When ICE runs between two peers, one agent acts as controlled, and the other as controlling.
				Rules are defined as a function of implementation type and offerer/answerer to determine who is controlling and who is controlled.
				However, the specification mentions that, in some cases, both sides might believe they are controlling, or both sides might believe they are controlled.

			<t>
				This flow is a variation on flow III of RFC 3725 <xref target="RFC3725"/>.
				In fact, it works better than flow III since it produces fewer messages.
				In this flow, the controller sends an offerless INVITE to agent A, which responds with its offer, SDP1.
				The agent then sends an offerless INVITE to agent B, which it responds to with its offer, SDP2.
				The controller then uses the offer from each agent to generate the answers.
				When this flow is used, ICE will run between agents A and B, but both will believe they are in the controlling role.
				With the role conflict resolution procedures, this flow will function properly when ICE is used.
			</t>

			<t>
				At this time, there are no documented flows that can result in the case where both agents believe they are controlled.
				However, the conflict resolution procedures allow for this case, should a flow arise that would fit into this category.

		<section title="Why Send an Updated Offer?">
			<t>
				Section 11.1 describes rules for sending media.
				Both agents can send media once ICE checks complete, without waiting for an updated offer.
				Indeed, the only purpose of the updated offer is to "correct" the SDP so that the default destination for media matches where media is being sent based on ICE procedures (which will be the highest-priority nominated candidate pair).
			</t>

			<t>
				This begs the question -- why is the updated offer/answer exchange needed at all?
				Indeed, in a pure offer/answer environment, it would not be.
				The offerer and answerer will agree on the candidates to use through ICE, and then can begin using them.
				As far as the agents themselves are concerned, the updated offer/answer provides no new information.
				However, in practice, numerous components along the signaling path look at the SDP information.
				These include entities performing off-path QoS reservations, NAT traversal components such as ALGs and Session Border Controllers (SBCs), and diagnostic tools that passively monitor the network.
				For these tools to continue to function without change, the core property of SDP -- that the existing, pre-ICE definitions of the addresses used for media -- the "m=" and "c=" lines and the rtcp attribute -- must be retained.
				For this reason, an updated offer must be sent.
